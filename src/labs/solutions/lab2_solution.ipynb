    "In today's lab we are going to consider the meteorologist problem. Assume there are $n$ weather stations, which predict what is the chance that it's going to rain or not. In the beginning we believe each weather station the same, that is, we believe that prior probability a given station is correct is equal to $\\frac{1}{n}$, and at any time prior probabilities sum up to 1. We consider a repeated problem, where we decide whether or not to take a coat outside. We're happy if we don't take the coat and it doesn't rain - after all we don't have to carry it around with ourselves. We are indifferent if it rains or not when we takea a coat - we're not getting wet after all. However, we really don't like if we don't take the coat and it rains, since we have the risk of getting sick. Our utility table can be summed up as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "| U | no rain | rain |\n",
    "| - | --------| ---- |\n",
    "| no coat | 1 | -10 |\n",
    "| coat | 0 | 0 |\n",

    "Your task is to update the belief about the meteo stations after observing outcomes (if it rains or not) and pick the best corresponding action, both by calculating the expected utility or using the MAP approach. First, implement fucntions calculating the marginal forecast for a given outcome in `marginal_prediction`."
