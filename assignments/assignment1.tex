\section{In-class exercises}
\begin{exercise}
  Case 1:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The reward is 500,000 with certainty.
  \item The reward is 2,500,000 with probability $0.10$. It is 500,000 with probability $0.89$, and 0 with probability $0.01$.
  \end{enumerate}

  Case 2:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The reward is 500,000 with probability $0.11$, or 0 with probability $0.89$.
  \item The reward is 2,500,000 with probability $0.1$, or 0 with probability $0.9$.
  \end{enumerate}

  Show that under the expected utility hypothesis, if gamble 1 is preferred in Case 1, gamble 1 must also be preferred in the Case 2, for any increasing utility function.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}[15]
  Consider the St. Petersburg paradox, where a coin is tossed until it comes heads. 
  We have estabilshed that if your utility for money is $U(x) = x$, and the coin was fair, i.e. the probability of heads was $1/2$
  then you should be willing to pay any amount to play the game. In this exercise, let us consider two alternative hypotheses:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item  Assume that the coin is fair, but your utility for money is $U(x) = ln x$. How much
    would you now be willing to pay to play the game? Hint: Calculate the expected
    utility of playing.
  \item Assume that the coin is not fair, but only comes head with probability 0.4, and your
    utility is linear: U(x) = x. How much would you be willing to play now?
  \item Perform an experiment to validate your claims using the code in \verb!src/paradox.ipynb!
  \end{itemize}
\end{exercise}


\section{Homework}
\begin{exercise}
  Assuming that $U$ is increasing and absolutely continuous, consider the following experiment:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item You specify an amount $a$, then observe random value $Y$.
  \item If $Y \geq a$, you receive $Y$ currency units.
  \item If $Y < a$, you receive a random amount $X$ with known distribution (independent of~$Y$).
  \end{enumerate}
  Show that we should choose $a$ such that $U(a) = \E[U(X)]$.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}[usefulness of probability and utility]
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Would it be useful to separate randomness from uncertainty? What would be desirable properties of an alternative concept to probability?
  \item Give an example of how the expected utility assumption might be violated.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{exercise}
