\begin{exercise}
  Case 1:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The reward is 500,000 with certainty.
  \item The reward is 2,500,000 with probability $0.10$. It is 500,000 with probability $0.89$, and 0 with probability $0.01$.
  \end{enumerate}

  Case 2:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The reward is 500,000 with probability $0.11$, or 0 with probability $0.89$.
  \item The reward is 2,500,000 with probability $0.1$, or 0 with probability $0.9$.
  \end{enumerate}

  Show that under the expected utility hypothesis, if gamble 1 is preferred in Case 1, gamble 1 must also be preferred in the Case 2, for any increasing utility function.
\end{exercise}

\begin{exercise}[15]
  Consider the St. Petersburg paradox, where a coin is tossed until it comes heads. 
  We have estabilshed that if your utility for money is $U(x) = x$, and the coin was fair, i.e. the probability of heads was $1/2$
  then you should be willing to pay any amount to play the game. In this exercise, let us consider two alternative hypotheses:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item  Assume that the coin is fair, but your utility for money is $U(x) = ln x$. How much
    would you now be willing to pay to play the game? Hint: Calculate the expected
    utility of playing.
  \item Assume that the coin is not fair, but only comes head with probability 0.4, and your
    utility is linear: U(x) = x. How much would you be willing to play now?
  \end{itemize}
